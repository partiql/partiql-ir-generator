/**
 * Manages the task of locating a file that was specified with the `include_file` statement.
 *
 * Terminology:
 *
 * - "includer": is a file containing an `include_file` statement. i.e. it is the file doing the including.
 * - "includee": is a file being included by the includer.
 *
 * @param searchDirs A list of directories to search after searching the directory containing the includer, normally
 * specified on the command-line.
 * @param fileSystem The instance of [FileSystem] to be used.  Allowing this to be specified instead of always using
 * the default [FileSystem] allows an in-memory file system to be used during tests. For production uses, use the
 * [FileSystem] returned from [FileSystems.getDefault] here.
 *
 * @throws InvalidIncludePathException if one of [searchDirs] does not exist or is not a directory.
