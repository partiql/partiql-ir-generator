This file is used to test the `include_file` statement.  Parsing this file and the files it includes is challenging -
 if we can do it correctly then we should be able to handle any `include_file` statement the user throws at us.

- Cyclic includes are tolerated without exception.
- Aboslute and relative paths are respected during include resolution.
- Searching across multiple search roots works.
