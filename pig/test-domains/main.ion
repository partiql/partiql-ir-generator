/*

This file is used to test the `(import <relative-path>)` statement.

Two primary things are tested:

- Cyclic imports are tolerated without exception.
- Relative paths, which are always relative to the directory containing the type universe currently being parsed.

└── other
    └── universe_b.ion          imports nothing


By parsing, main.ion (this file), we test that each of the other files is imported (directly or indirectly). Each
.ion file (except for "import_b.ion") defines a type domain, for a total of 4 type domains.  The test is successful
if main.ion can be imported without error and results in a single universe with all 4 type domains.
